          <h5>What is LARP?</h5>
          <p>In Live-Action Role Playing games, you physically act out the actions of your character. You take on the role of someone in a story and decide what they will say and do, interacting with (or against!) other players, with any conflict or contention between characters mediated by a gamemaster. Events range in tone from game-like comedies to angst-filled dramas and from combat-driven dungeon-crawls to tense diplomatic arguments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel">
          <h5>So, how does this event work?</h5>
          <p>After a short talk about types of LARPs, why people LARP, and general guidelines for LARPing, we'll figure out who's going to play what and dive in! Each game is one or two hours long and players will be able to try a wide variety of games.</p>
          <p>No preparation, costuming, or creation creation is needed, just show up with an open mind and your wonderful self. We recommend wearing comfortable clothing that you can move and walk around in.</p>
          <p>Your friendly neighborhood STs (storytellers) will be there to help you pick out which game is best for you, and we recommend reading through the game descriptions ahead of time for maximum excitement. There's no preregistration or RSVP, and you'll have a chance to pick which games you'd like to play at the event.</p>
          <p>Absolutely no LARP or gaming experience is needed to have a great time. This event is intended for both people who've never LARPed before and people who've been LARPing for ages.</p>

              <div id="panel1a" class="content active">

                <br><br>
                The people of Earth are stupid. They have built a device that will destroy the universe. We are part of that universe and must stop them. You have been summoned to the post mortem meeting for Plan Eight and the discussion of Plan Nine.
                <br><br>
                “Plan Eight” is inspired by the incomparable movie “Plan Nine from Outer Space” It has no rules for combat or real game mechanics of any sort. It emphasizes roleplaying, characterization, and interaction over puzzle solving or adventuring. Prepare to play an over-the-top character, chewing scenery as required. Warning: there will be Power Point.
                <br><br>
                A game for 8 players.

                By Jason Morningstar
                <br><br>Oh my goodness did that ever go wrong. Shots were fired, mostly into Toad there, and the four of you got away with a bag containing less loot than you’d planned. A lot less. Now you are on the road, running for your lives and counting your blessings. You have your health (Toad does not have that), you have your friends (not friends), and you each have a still-warm piece tucked into your pants. You have eleven treasures to split four ways and that is not going to be pretty. Things are not looking up.
                <br><br>Out of Dodge is a four-person, “American Freeform” live-action game about desperate criminals on a car ride to nowhere.
                <br><br>This game includes mature language in the rules and generally deals with themes of betrayal and extreme violence.

              <div id="panel4a" class="content">
                By Jim Edwards-Hewitt
                <br><br>
                Klingon Group Therapy! is a lighthearted look at the dark underbelly of the Klingon psyche.
                <br><br>Warriors! Does your mind harbor secrets that might cause your hand to hesitate when it is time to strike? Are you truly free of hidden weaknesses? Join your brother and sister warriors in a new ritual to unleash your potential and put your feet on your true path!
                <br><br>The Federation is recruiting exodynamic therapists and self-help gurus for an important new outreach program in alien systems. Experience with ex-offenders and other difficult cases especially sought. (Hand-to-hand combat skills a plus.)
                <br><br>As part of the Khitomer Accords setting up Federation assistance to the devastated Klingon Empire, the Klingons were required to accept experimental Federation social programs, including KLINGON GROUP THERAPY! Was it a sincere attempt to give Klingons the benefit of centuries of human psychotherapy? Or was it an attempt by the ultra-secret Section 31 to subtly curb their violent and warlike tendencies? Either way, no one could have predicted the results...
                <br><br>A game for one therapist and three or more Klingons. Games may be, err, cut short, but a wide array of Klingons allows for multiple runs.

                By TNT Productions (Jeff Diewald, Lynn Anslow, Susan Giusto, Tim Lasko, Barry Tannenbaum)
                <br><br>Across the Sea of Stars is a ten-hour larp for twenty five players. In the full game, which we will not be running, besides playing “home characters” integral to the overall story, players also play a variety of short larp scenarios—tales that took place in the past, that set the stage and develop the plots for the central game. We will have a selection of these tales available for your enjoyment.
                <br><br>The tales reflect classic science-fiction tropes and settings, range from the humorous to the tragic, take 3 to 6 players, and will take 10 to 20 minutes each to play. The website for the full game can be found at http://home.comcast.net/~diewald/across_the_sea_of_stars/home.html

                Based on the movie of the same name (don't worry if you have/haven't seen it), you have applied for the job of a lifetime. You simply have to pass the final evaluation. A problem is before you; a solution is required. A clock counts down 60 minutes. Will you cooperate with the other applicants or cheat and betray them? Will you discover the solution? Will you figure out the problem?
                <br><br>A game of puzzle-solving and role-playing for 4-6 people.
