          <h3>What is LARP?</h3>
          <p>In Live-Action Role Playing games, you physically act out the actions of your character. You take on the role of someone in a story and decide what they will say and do, interacting with (or against!) other players, with any conflict or contention between characters mediated by a gamemaster. Events range in tone from game-like comedies to angst-filled dramas and from combat-driven dungeon-crawls to tense diplomatic arguments.</p>

          <h3>So, how does this event work?</h3>
          <p>After a short talk about types of LARPs, why people LARP, and general guidelines for LARPing, we'll figure out who's going to play what and dive in! Each game is one or two hours long and players will be able to try a wide variety of games.</p>
          <p>No preparation, costuming, or creation creation is needed, just show up with an open mind and your wonderful self. We recommend wearing comfortable clothing that you can move and walk around in. Wear something minimally distracting if you can, and wearing all black is always a good choice.</p>
          <p>Your friendly neighborhood STs (storytellers) will be there to help you pick out which game is best for you, and we recommend reading through the game descriptions ahead of time for maximum excitement. There's no preregistration or RSVP, and you'll have a chance to pick which games you'd like to play at the event.</p>
          <p>Absolutely no LARP or gaming experience is needed to have a great time. This event is intended for both people who've never LARPed before and people who've been LARPing for ages.</p>
